Examples
========

To help get you started using ``mrpy``, we've compiled a few examples. In fact, many of these examples are used explicitly
to produce the figures which appear in the MRP paper (Murray, Robotham, Power 2016). Other simple examples can be found in
the API documentation for each object.

*So, what would you like to learn?*
